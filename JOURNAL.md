## 11/6/2025 5 PM - Planning  

i thought about making this for some time now and i researched what mcu i could use
rp2354 is great because it has built in flash and nice security features
i also decided i dont want nfc and ill do dual usb types so i can use it on any device i have
i found existing firmwares for security keys that support the rp2354 so i could take some inspiration from that
im gonna start doing the schematic

## 11/6/2025 11 PM - Schematic progress  

slowly going thru the datasheets, reference designs and other rp2350 resources
i think i have most of the things done, i need to wire up the led, buttons and i think i'll go with capacitive touch for the confirm button
