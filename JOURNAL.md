## 11/6/2025 - Planning  

i thought about making this for some time now and i researched what mcu i could use
rp2354 is great because it has built in flash and nice security features
i also decided i dont want nfc and ill do dual usb types so i can use it on any device i have
i found existing firmwares for security keys that support the rp2354 so i could take some inspiration from that
im gonna start doing the schematic
